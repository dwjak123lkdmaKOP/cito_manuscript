## cito: An R package for training neural networks using torch

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results in manuscript ‘cito: An R package for training neural networks using torch’

### Benchmarking of runtime and error

Setup: 5 hidden layers, nodes per layer were increased from 50 to 1,000
with a stepsize of 50. Dataset contained 20 predictors (sampled from a
uniform distribution (0,1)) with 2,000 observations (1,000 were used for
training and 1,000 for evaluation (RMSE)). Each step (number of nodes)
were replicated 20 times.

To run the benchmarking:

alt="Figure  1: Comparison of different deep learning packages (brulee, h2o, neuralnet, and cito (CPU and GPU)) on different network sizes on an Intel Xeon 6128 and a Nvidia RTX 2080ti. The networks consist of five equally sized layers (50 to 1000 nodes with a step size of 50) and are trained on a simulated data set with 1000 observations. Panel (A) shows the runtime of the different packages and panel (B) shows the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the models on a holdout of size 1000 observations (RMSE was averaged over different network sizes). Each network was trained 20 times (the dataset was resampled each time)." />
